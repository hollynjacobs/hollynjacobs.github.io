<div> While I was home in New Jersey for winter break I decided to get a Kitten, even though my mom hates cats. She is my little secret from my parents. Even though she was in my house a couple days, she was so well behaved that my parents did  not even notice.</div>
<div> She is only about 4 months old and I've loved watching her grow every day!</div>
<p></p>
<div> In all honesty she is my pride and joy, I treat her like she would be my own human child and baby her in every way I can.</div>
