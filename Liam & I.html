<div> About a year and a half ago I met my bestfriend here at the University of Maine.
We both lived in York hall on campus and saw eachother in the dinning hall and that is how we met, ever since then we have been best friends. Not to mention my significant other for the past year and a half.</div>

<div> Liam has grandparents in Florida with a condo right on the water, and they had flew us down there for a week so so we could enjoy the warm weather before heading back up to Maine's cold weather. </div>
